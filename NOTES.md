## TODO
### Required
### Brainstorming
1. Twitch chat filter?
2. Autofill (tab?, settings)
3. Jump to first x1
    - is there room for split screen?
    - click to swap filter type
4. paste anywhere 
    - current method default input is easy, but not contenteditable
    - just figure out the normal paste event
5. Send more than message data
    - more data, and will add another set to track, but can elimitate duplicates with the id more accurately
    - handling the data moves location
